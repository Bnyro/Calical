# Calculator
An open source calculator for Android using Material You.

## Why
The only well-known calculator using Material You is currently the Google calculator which uses permissions it doesn't need and has Google trackers inbuilt. That's why I decided to build a good looking alternative that respects the users privacy.

## Features

- [x] Material You
- [x] Dark and light theme
- [x] Lightweight and fast
- [x] Support for complex functions
- [x] No permissions needed
- [x] No ads
